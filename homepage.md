## Step 1: Accessing the Site Editor
1. Log in to your Podia account.

**Note**: If this is your first time accessing the Site Editor, Podia may prompt you to choose a starting point (e.g., Blank site, Email lander, Link page, or Full website). Select the option that best suits your needs or choose **Blank site** to start from scratch.

## Step 2: Setting the Homepage
Podia automatically designates a default homepage for your site, but you can set a custom homepage or modify the existing one.

### To Set a Custom Homepage:
1. In the Site Editor, click the **page navigation** menu (typically in the top left corner).
2. Find the page you want to set as the homepage from the list of pages.

3. Click the **"..."** (more options) next to the page name and select **"Set as homepage"**. This designates the selected page as your site’s homepage.

4. If you don’t have a page ready, create a new one (see Step 3) and set it as the homepage.

**Note**: Only one page can be set as the homepage at a time. Changing the homepage will update the default landing page for your site’s URL.

## Step 3: Adding a New Homepage
If you want to create a new page to serve as your homepage:
1. In the Site Editor, click the **page navigation** menu in the top left corner.
2. Select **"Add new page"** or click the **"+"** icon to create a blank page.[](https://help.podia.com/en/articles/4808400-how-to-add-a-custom-page)[](https://help.podia.com/en/articles/176-adding-a-new-page-to-your-site)
3. Name the page (e.g., “Home” or “Welcome”) and confirm its creation.
4. Set this page as the homepage by following the steps in **Step 2**.

- **No Direct HTML/CSS Editing**: Custom CSS is required for advanced styling, but Podia does not offer support for custom code. [Note](https://help.podia.com/en/articles/3186171-how-does-podia-work-with-my-existing-website)[](https://bloggingwizard.com/podia-review/)
- **Basic Features**: The Site Editor is designed for simplicity, so it may lack advanced customization options for complex layouts. [Note](https://kristineneil.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-podia)
